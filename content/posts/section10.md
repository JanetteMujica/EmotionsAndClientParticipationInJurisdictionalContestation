Empirical studies indicate that, when established arrangements are contested, incumbent actors such as professions engage in defensive framing efforts to evoke fear and shame in forms that lead members of their target audiences to work in support of continuity {{< cite "Gill-2018;Douglas_creed-2014" >}}. Building on this insight, we argue that a profession whose jurisdictional control is contested by a social movement engages in framing efforts to evoke in clients a fear of relying on the alternative project promoted by the movement. It does so by framing the movement’s experiential knowledge as irrelevant, dangerous, and/or unreliable {{< cite "Chesler-1987;Edelman-1974" >}}. By seeking to evoke this form of fear in individual clients in relation to the movement, profession members attempt to undermine the trust of individual clients in the experiential knowledge on which rests the movement’s alternative project {{< cite "Decelles-2020" >}} For example, a study of childbirth experiences suggests that obstetrics professionals seek to evoke fear in pregnant women of complications related to giving birth at home accompanied by peers, thereby attempting to undermine the trust of these women in the home birth movement {{< cite "Stoll-2018" >}}.

Similarly, drawing on these studies we suggest that a profession faced with jurisdictional contestation engages in defensive framing efforts to evoke in clients a shame of deviating from its prescriptions. The profession does so by framing deviance from its prescriptions as a moral flaw and/or a self-degradation {{< cite "Douglas_creed-2014;Dejordy-2014" >}}. By seeking to evoke this form of shame in individual clients in relation to the movement, profession members attempt to cause their detachment from the movement as a collective actor. For example, medical professionals seek to shame patients in whom they diagnose obesity into compliance with the profession’s eating, exercising, and treatment prescriptions {{< cite "Cody-2022" >}}, attempting to cause these patients’ detachment from the fat acceptance movement {{< cite "Cooper-2016" >}}.

Studies also indicate that incumbent actors facing contestation seek to evoke anger and pride in forms that lead members of their target audience to work in support of continuity {{< cite "Wright-2017;Massa-2017" >}}. Thus, we argue that a profession facing jurisdictional contestation by a social movement engages in framing efforts to evoke anger in clients at the movement for jeopardizing a proper response to their needs. It does so by framing compliance with the profession’s prescriptions as a righteous imperative {{< cite "Wright-2017;Haidt-2003" >}}. By seeking to evoke this form of anger in individual clients in relation to the movement, profession members attempt to gain the attachment of clients to the profession as a collective actor. For example, insider researcher {{< cite "Gould-2009" >}} recounts how the medical profession and pharmaceutical industry sought to evoke the anger of people living with HIV/AIDS and direct it at ACT/UP activists whose disruptive protest tactics, the medical profession claimed, compromised the development and distribution of treatments that people living with HIV/AIDS urgently needed. In doing so, the profession was attempting to gain the attachment of individual clients in it as a responsible collective actor trying to uphold established arrangements which, the profession argued, benefited people living with HIV/AIDS.

We also argue that a profession faced with jurisdictional contestation engages in defensive framing efforts to evoke in clients a pride of supporting established arrangements. It does so by framing the profession’s expert knowledge as relevant, safe, and/or reliable {{< cite Lawrence-2017 >}}. By seeking to evoke this form of pride in individual clients in relation to the profession, professionals attempt to strengthen the trust of clients in the profession’s expert knowledge. This bond of trust in expert knowledge provides supportive audience members with a reassuring sense of being cared for by a dutiful collective of professionals {{< cite "Evetts-2006;Lewis-1985" >}}. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals presented themselves in the media as selfless “saviors” by telling their inspiring stories of dutifully working “at the forefront, keeping themselves and their families at risk just to treat this disease and save lives” {{< cite "Kumar-2022" >}}. Such framing efforts seek to evoke the pride of citizens in supporting the healthcare professions, as well as to cultivate the public’s trust in their expert knowledge amid the global pandemic.

In sum, we build on social studies of emotions to argue that professions facing jurisdictional contestation engage in defensive framing efforts to evoke _fear_ and _shame_ in ways that undermine the trust of clients in the experiential knowledge of a challenger movement and cause the detachment of clients from the movement, respectively. Additionally, we argue that professions in such situations also engage, although to a lesser extent, in defensive framing efforts to evoke _anger_ and _pride_ in ways that gain the attachment of clients to the profession and strengthen their trust in its expert knowledge, respectively.
