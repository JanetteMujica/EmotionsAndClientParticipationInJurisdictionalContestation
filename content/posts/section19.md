Organizational studies of professions have mainly considered episodes of jurisdictional contestation initiated by regulators and managers {{< cite "Ackroyd-1996;Waring-2009" >}}. Our paper theorizes efforts from social movements to bring individual clients into collective action to alter the boundaries and content of a profession’s work. The model expands relational understandings of jurisdictional control as grounded in how a profession relates to its clientele {{< cite "Chan-2021;Huising-2021;Evans-2021;Eyal-2019" >}}. By foregrounding how jurisdictional control depends on clients’ trust in a profession’s expert knowledge and attachment to it as a collective actor, we present continuity in jurisdictional control as an ongoing achievement that is imperiled by contestation from a client-led social movement, thus shedding new light on existing literature focused on regulators and managers.

Notable similarities and differences become apparent when episodes of contestation by regulators and managers are compared with those by client-led social movements. On one hand, they are similar because, in both cases, the jurisdictional control of a profession is disrupted by a collective actor and, as a result, arrangements in a work domain may be altered. Also, in both cases the change project sought by the collective actor initiating the episode is likely to be resisted by the contested profession {{< cite "Langley-2019" >}}. On the other hand, they are different because contestation by regulators and managers produces a struggle between high-status actors wielding distinct forms of formal authority, whereas contestation by a social movement produces a struggle between a high-status actor with formal authority (the profession) and a low-status one without it (the movement). That is, contestation from regulators and managers gives rise to a struggle between powerful incumbents over the boundaries of recognized jurisdictions, while contestation from a social movement gives rise to a struggle between an incumbent profession and a marginalized challenger without any recognized claim to jurisdiction (cf. Fligstein and McAdam, 2012). This asymmetry shifts the dynamics of the struggle. Unlike regulators and managers who seek support from profession members to implement reform {{< cite "Kellogg-2009;Bucher-2016" >}}, the social movements we theorize seek to enlist clients in collective action to alter the boundaries and content of a profession’ work {{< cite "Gould-2009;Bayer-1987" >}}.

Our focus on clients adds insights to the literature by foregrounding a basis for jurisdictional contestation that is quite different from the formal regulatory and managerial authority of actors most studied so far {{< cite "Courpasson-2000;Suddaby-2007" >}}. Social movements rely on the experiential knowledge of their adherents to gain clients’ support for their alternative projects. This distinctly epistemic basis for contestation is important because it creates unique complications for a profession seeking to defend its jurisdiction by invoking the authority of its expert knowledge {{< cite "Eyal-2019" >}}. The means of construction, transmission, and validation of experiential knowledge are different from those of expert knowledge. They involve mutual sharing of first-person accounts within communities of experiential peers, with much of this narrative work taking place within dedicated spaces where professionals are not invited {{< cite "Borkman-1999;Epstein-2008" >}}. Within these peer-only spaces, the subjectivity and unicity of individual experiences are valorized and bind movement adherents to each other, while the objectivity and generalizability claimed by holders of expert knowledge are problematized and often dismissed {{< cite "Jouet-2010;Taylor-2000" >}}. Social movements are formidable jurisdictional contestants because they validate the experiential knowledge of clients and encourage them to voice their aspirations for change.

Regulators and managers have sought to systematize expert knowledge and ease its sharing across professional boundaries, typically for reasons of efficiency and organizational flexibility {{< cite "Waring-2009;Bucher-2016" >}}. Studies of jursdictional contestation by regulators and managers present their knowledge as complementary to professionals’ knowledge rather than substitute for it {{< cite "Scott-2000" >}}. In contrast, social movements promote the use of adherents’ experiential knowledge to address clients’ needs as a legitimate substitute for expert knowledge in at least some important aspects of the profession’s work domain. This unique basis for jurisdictional contestation has important implications for how episodes of contestation play out, including the role of emotions in them.
