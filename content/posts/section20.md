The experiential epistemic basis for client contestation of a profession’s jurisdiction results in a more prominent role for emotions as compared to regulators and managers. This difference likely arises because the construction, validation, and transmission of expert knowledge is guided by ideals of distance and objectivity which invalidate emotional experience as a way of knowing and repress its display {{< cite "Collinson-2003;Fournier-1999" >}}. In contrast, adherents to social movements valorize emotional experience as a form of knowledge about self and society {{< cite "Borkman-1999" >}}. Movement adherents encourage their peers to display pride openly, as a mechanism for bonding and affirmation {{< cite "Taylor-2000;Schrock-2004" >}}; while engaging in collective outbursts of anger is a well-known social movement tactic for getting the attention of incumbents whose practices are targeted for change such as governments, corporations, and professions {{< cite "Bayer-1987;Gould-2009" >}}. Thus, our model highlights the central role of social emotions when clients contest a profession’s jurisdiction.

Most organizational research on jurisdictional contestation of professions, in contrast, has not focused on social emotions. Studies focusing on contestation by regulators and managers have mostly overlooked the emotions of contestants, describing struggles between collective actors pursuing divergent institutional projects as driven by power or efficiency considerations {{< cite "Scott-2000;Brint-1994" >}}. A few recent studies of jurisdictional contestation exploring the role of clients have begun to integrate emotions. In their study of profession stigmatization, {{< cite "Wang-2021" >}} found that individual clients angry at the medical profession sought to alter the profession’s prescribing practices by evoking shame in medical professionals. However, the phenomenon described by the authors is different to the one we theorize; no social movement is mentioned and, instead, news media are credited with amplifying the conflict although, and consistent with our model, felt anger led clients to oppose the profession. {{< cite "Mukherjee-2022" >}} (in-press) find that palliative care professionals manage ‘feeling rules’ that define what forms of fear, hope and guilt constitute an ‘appropriate’ emotional response from clients to the profession’s work. This study suggests that in their everyday work professions seek to evoke―and are generally successful at achieving resonance of―specific forms of emotions which _preclude_ jurisdictional contestation by clients.

So, despite some recent attention to emotions and professions, an integrative treatment of social emotions has not informed jurisdictional contestation research. Our theorizing of how social emotions shape client participation in the contestation of a profession’s jurisdictional control is therefore novel and advances research in multiple ways. First, it brings together insights scattered across a vast, heterogeneous literature, including studies of emotions in social movements and their struggles against opponents {{< cite "Gould-2009;Schrock-2004;Britt-2000" >}}. This voluminous work, however, does not consider the implications of its findings for professions and the work domains they control, as we have done in this paper.

Second, our model adds a nuanced understanding of social emotions to research on jurisdictional contestation by considering a constellation of four intertwined social emotions; theorizing both sides of a framing contest to gain clients’ support; and distinguishing between, but also bringing together, emotional evocation and resonance. In conceptualizing social emotions in research on contestation of a profession’s jurisdictional control in this way, our model goes beyond studies that focus on a single emotion {{< cite "Gill-2018" >}}; the framing efforts of one collective actor {{< cite "Moisander-2016" >}}; and either emotional evocation {{< cite "Goodrick-2020" >}} or emotional resonance {{< cite "Giorgi-2017" >}}. By integrating these components into a single model, our integrative approach to social emotions makes an important contribution because it allows us to shed light on the origins and critical role of ambivalence in jurisdictional contestation of professions by client-led social movements.
