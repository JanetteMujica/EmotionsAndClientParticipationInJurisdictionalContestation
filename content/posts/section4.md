A profession’s clientele is heterogeneous {{< cite "Chan-2021" >}} and composed of segments with different social locations and embodied experiences {{< cite "Robnett-2004" >}}. Each person has a singular history, nourishes specific aspirations and commitments {{< cite "Creed-2022;Voronov-2020" >}}, and experiences unique needs, even if their needs are shaped by the social groups to which they are attached {{< cite "Barbalet-1996" >}}. The trust of individual clients in the expert knowledge of a profession is shaped by a felt alignment between their needs and how a profession interprets and responds to them {{< cite "Fayard-2017;Huising-2015" >}}. Therefore, when a social movement frames a profession’s expert knowledge as technically irrelevant, dangerous, and/or morally corrupt, it risks undermining clients’ trust in its expert knowledge and disrupting the profession’s jurisdictional control {{< cite "Eyal-2019;Gurri-2018" >}}.

The disruptive framing efforts of a social movement typically rely on the experiential knowledge collectively held by its adherents, which forms a distinct epistemic basis on which to legitimize an evaluation of the profession’s work as flawed; and to promote a preferable alternative, peer-driven institutional project [cf. {{< cite "Diamond-2013;Taylor_v-2000" >}}. {{< cite "Borkman-1976" >}}, p446], a pioneering sociologist of mutual aid, has defined _experiential knowledge_ as a “concrete, specific, and commonsensical (…) wisdom and know-how gained from personal participation in a phenomenon.” Her research indicates that a person’s experiential knowledge is validated by the “conviction that the insights learned from direct participation in a situation are truth, because the individual has faith in the validity and authority of the knowledge obtained by being part of a phenomenon” (p. 447). Research on mutual aid groups has shown that the construction of experiential knowledge is a collective, interpretive process involving peers giving meaning to their lived experiences through reciprocal sharing of first-person accounts in dedicated spaces {{< cite "Jouet-2010;Epstein-2008" >}}.

The social movements we have in mind are of this kind. They emerge from marginalized identity-based communities seeking to emancipate themselves from internalized conceptions of being flawed and dependencies on others, including professionals, that are taken for granted. They validate the experiential knowledge of individual clients and help clients to reinterpret their situation as being caused by societal prejudice and systemic injustice in which a profession’s expert knowledge is deeply implicated, according to movement adherents [e.g., {{< cite "Gould-2009;Schrock-2004;Britt-2000" >}}. Because this consciousness raising and mobilization is commonly described as a highly emotional process, we next consider how emotions lead an individual client to participate in jurisdictional contestation.
